Any changes to ZoneMinder's configuration should be made here in this folder,
rather than directly editing the default zm.conf file.

ZoneMinder will process each file in this folder with a ".conf" extension.
Each "Var = Value" pair, in each config file, will be loaded into ZoneMinder's
running configuration, overriding any variables with the same name found in the 
default zm.conf file.

After creating a custom config file, don't forget to set the proper file and
owner permission on it. For example, this is typically what you should do after
saving the config file to disk:

    sudo chown root:apache *.conf
    sudo chmod 640 *.conf

Substitute "apache" with the name of the web server user account on your system.
